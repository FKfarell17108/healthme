# healthme - Machine-Learning Based Website with Python

## Descriptions

This project is machine learning built using Python.
This project demonstrates the implementation of machine learning for personalisation of public health in reducing non-communicable diseases.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models using selected algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the trained models.
- **Prediction**: Uses the trained models to make predictions on new data.

## Technology Used

- Python
- Libraries: 
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive coding and visualization)

## Installations

1. Clone this repository to your local computer using the command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   
2. Go into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd repository-name

3. Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
4. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
